                <p>My name is Kurt Dusek, I built this app in response to the code challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    From an application architecture standpoint, my overall approach was to define a prototype for a DataProvider class which could be inherited from
                    to easily create a standardized data source from various exchanges.
                    A given exchange can be added to the app by implementing this DataProvider prototype to wrap its various API calls
                    and convert its proprietary order book format into Order objects.
                </p>
                <p>From there, the DataStore object consumes each instance of a DataProvider
                    and provides business logic to structure individual orders as a complete market for a given symbol. Additionally,
                    the DataStore handles refreshing each DataProvider, utilizes map reduce to pass structured market data into React
                    and searches for and identifies overlapping orders.</p>
                <p>
                    In addition to the main requirement I completed all of the extra point items and generated a bit of documentation to provide a little context.
                    I enjoyed the challenge in developing this, it allowed me to polish my javascript skills and learn about React.js.
                    I've been curious about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology for the last few years and the opportunity to get involved with an innovative company excites me very much.
                    I appreciate the opportunity to be considered for a position with your company.
                </p>

                <p>Thanks again<br/><br />
